# sochan_tracker
i had a funny idea of creating a tool that simplifies process of finding out how did jeremy sochan do in his last game. this app will be focused solely on him

this app will be a collecion of methods that use NBA APIs endpoints https://github.com/swar/nba_api 

currently it consists of returning sochan's last 5 games stats

app is up and running on https://misterinho.com/sochan_tracker/

note: nba blocks IP addresses from many server providers, including digital ocean, hetzner, etc. keep that in mind if you plan to host the api on remote server
