# sochan_tracker
python app, work starts in february 2024

i had a funny idea of creating a tool that simplifies process of finding out how did jeremy sochan do in his last game. this app will be focused solely on him

this app will be a collecion of methods that use NBA APIs endpoints https://github.com/swar/nba_api 

not sure how i want to present data, must be easy to use. i was thinking about a one page website with his last performance and stats from his last 5 games
